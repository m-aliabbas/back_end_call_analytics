# Certainly, you can implement streaming without using 
# Flask by directly using Python and its built-in `requests` 
# module for handling HTTP requests. Below is a simplified example
# of streaming data in chunks using plain Python.

import requests

def generate_data():
    # Connect to MongoDB and retrieve data
    # Replace the following lines with your MongoDB connection and query logic
    mongodb_uri = 'your_mongodb_uri'
    response = requests.get(f'{mongodb_uri}/your_database/your_collection')
    data = response.json()

    for document in data:
        # Process the document as needed
        processed_data = process_document(document)

        # Yield the processed data as a chunk
        yield processed_data

def process_document(document):
    # Implement your document processing logic here
    # ...

    return processed_data

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace the URL with your API endpoint
    api_url = 'http://your_api_endpoint/stream_data'

    # Send a GET request to the API endpoint for streaming data
    response = requests.get(api_url, stream=True)

    # Process the streamed data
    for chunk in response.iter_lines():
        # Handle each chunk of data as needed
        process_chunk(chunk)


# In this example:

# 1. The `generate_data` function is similar to the previous example, 
# but instead of using Flask, it directly fetches data from MongoDB using 
# the `requests` module.

# 2. The `process_document` function is a placeholder for any processing 
# logic you need to apply to each document before streaming it.

# 3. In the `__main__` block, a GET request is made to the API endpoint 
# that you've set up for streaming (`api_url`). The `stream=True` 
# parameter is used to enable streaming.

# 4. The `response.iter_lines()` method is used to iterate over the 
# streamed data in chunks.

# 5. The `process_chunk` function (not shown in the example) is a 
# placeholder for handling each chunk of data as needed.

# This is a basic example, and you'll need to adapt it to fit your 
# specific use case and integrate it with your MongoDB setup. Keep 
# in mind that using a web framework like Flask can simplify the process, 
# but it's certainly possible to achieve streaming without it if you 
# prefer a lightweight solution.
